# IPFS-SwarmAnalysis
This repository contains the source code related to the project developed for the P2P Systems and Blockchains course of University of Pisa.
The code has been developed to gather some data by monitoring the IPFS P2P network, in order to retrieve information about the swarm of peers. The content of the DHT has been periodically retrieved as well. I have then elaborated some statistics and reasoning about the data. A more detailed explanation and the results of the analysis are contained in the file IPFS_SwarmAnalysis.pdf.
